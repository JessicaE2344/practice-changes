# u0-project-Gutenberg-Snoopy

## Description

`Gutenberg` is a command line application that allows users to interact with a list of books that have been made freely available by the good people at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

> **NOTE:** We don't have data for **all** the Project Gutenberg books, but we've got close to 10,000. That's probably plenty.

See [Description.md](./DESCRIPTION.md)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To start, you will need to clone the repository. In the terminal type the following:

1. mkdir "insert file name here"
2. cd "file name of your new directory"
3. This is for the https: git clone https://github.com/nss-se-cohort-3/u0-project-gutenberg-snoopy.git
-  This is for the SSH: git clone git@github.com:nss-se-cohort-3/u0-project-gutenberg-snoopy.git 
4. ./gradlew build
5. ./gradlew run

Here are screenshots of the application and the interface:

When you run the application within the terminal this is how your screen should appear.

This is an example of one of the functions. I started by choosing Option 3, search books by author, then  entered agatha. This was the return of that data.
